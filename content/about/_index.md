- I am interested tropical ecology, tree species dominance and distribution, and traditional uses by local communities in tropical and mediterranean systems.
- I study temporal population dynamics across multiple taxonomic groups, assessing how robust current biodiversity trend estimates are for detecting changes in pollinator populations at global scales. My work combines statistical modeling, large-scale dataset analysis, and the development of novel monitoring approaches for pollinators.
- I like to understand complex ecological interactions contained in data (R, modelling, statistics, programming, code efficiency) and through visualizations (illustration, design, graphs). 
- I integrate ecological theory, strong technical skills, innovation, and collaboration to foster an open, ethical, dynamic, and creative approach to science.
